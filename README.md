# 2-portfolio🌟 Portfolio Website Overview – Vishnu R
This project is a highly interactive and animated personal portfolio website that creatively showcases my journey, skills, and interests as a Junior Web Developer. I’ve focused on blending visual appeal, smooth animations, and responsive design to deliver an engaging user experience.

🔧 Key Features I Developed:
🖼️ Animated Gradient Background
The background uses a multi-color linear gradient animation that moves fluidly to create a vibrant, modern visual experience.

This brings energy and motion to the site without being distracting.

🎴 3D Flipping Project Cards
Each project is displayed using a 3D flip card animation.

When hovered, the cards rotate on the Y-axis to reveal more information about the project, giving a dynamic interactive effect.

🐦 Flying Bird Animation
A realistic flying bird animation (GIF) was added, flying in a circular path around the page using CSS keyframe animation.

This symbolizes motion and creativity, adding a unique touch to the design.

⌨️ Typing Text Animation
The heading “Vishnu R” uses a typing effect animation, making it look like it's being typed in real-time.

Paired with a blinking cursor effect for a developer-inspired look.

🧑‍💼 About Me Section
Clearly written, detailed section introducing myself, my background, and my shift from UPSC preparation to web development.

Explains why I chose IT and reflects my passion and motivation.

🎨 Hobbies & Interests Section
Features clickable cards for Web Development, Reading, and Drawing.

Each hobby includes a meaningful external link, making it interactive.

📱 Responsive Design
Fully responsive layout using media queries ensures the site looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Cards and containers adjust to smaller screens with good readability and usability.

🌐 Social Media Integration
Linked icons (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook) styled with Font Awesome for quick access to social profiles.
